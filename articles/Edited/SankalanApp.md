The registration for Sankalan’22 was made available through an android application named “Sankalan DUCS” on the google play store for free to download and use. The application is designed to serve the best user experience at the entry-level. The application focuses on providing easy access to information about the competitions, events, details, time, venue etc.

The application team made sure to keep the UI experience-rich and simple for the user.
The application uses the MVVM (Model-view-ViewModel) type architecture to separate the UI, logic and data models for the application. The app team has integrated jetpack components and architecture components into the application for a good code base.

All the libraries used in the application are up-to-date. The application takes minimum data from the user and stores it in the cloud; hence application protects the privacy, availability and integrity of the user data.

The application is integrated with the Firebase real-time database and Firebase Storage, for storing the user data. The user of the application is authenticated and managed using Firebase Authentication. And to enhance and maintain the application it is also integrated with Firebase Crash Analytics which detects crashes on the user device and provides an error report to the application team.

The application is free and open-source and is freely available on Github - <https://github.com/NavneetKumar2907/Sankalan>
