Technologies are Ever- evolving, from a last some past years as we have seen the incredible growth in technology in many fields, whether it is Medicine, healthcare, Artificial Intelligence(AI), blockchain and many more. These technologies are transforming our lives today.

So in future, we also see these types of Technologies:-

## Edge Computing 

Edge computing is a current technology development that brings data storage and computation closer to business improving reaction time and reducing bandwidth uses. It is also considered to be the most recent technology strength because enterprises are rapidly gaining access to Sophisticated and specialized resources which ensures reduced leniency. Edge computing secures to new high by local compliance with privacy legislation and data sovereignty concerns. Although many people feel that edge computing increases attacks services. It reduces the influence of an enterprise. Other benefits of edge computing include enhanced speed and reduce costs. Top tier companies like DELL, AWS, Google cloud platform, HPE and IBM etc are ready to adopt edge computing.

## Human Augmentation

Enhancing the person's physical and cognitive abilities are known as Human Augmentation.

Once planted in a person it will allow them to perform activities that were previously impossible. Human Augmentation is one of the most recent technological advancement in a postmodern age that would not only improve the human physical endurance but also their ability to think and make better decisions. It has a lot of promising in technology.

## AI or Artificial Intelligence

It has proven one of the most transformative tech evolutions. However, in the current world scenarios, it seems the most useful technology and promising technology in today's world. Some AI technology like ALTEREGO- a mind-reading wearable and citizen robots like Sophia are indicators of how AI become the most highly effective technology in incoming years. Domicopter Test delivery has been already tested by some companies Dominos and Doordash.

Despite that these technologies are still riddled with flaws that threaten human safety. AI technology is becoming a technological trend in the future by giving it more potential. Companies like NVIDIA, Google, and Microsoft has been adopted artificial intelligence in some way or other.

## Quantum Computing
It is designed to resolve difficulties simply it still comes at a cost by superimposing and entanglement. These computers explore quantum mechanics to address difficulties. It has the ability to analyze and act on data, regardless of the source. Another field where quantum computing is found is banking and finance, to manage credit risk, for high-frequency trading and fraud detection.

## Computer Vision
It is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows computers to extract important information from digital photos, videos and other visual inputs as well as to conduct actions or make a recommendation based on that data. AI has made a significant try in recent years to pass humans in several tasks relating to object detection and classification. Thanks to  BREAKTHROUGHS in artificial intelligence and innovation in deep learning and neural networks.

Computer vision has employed a variety of industries including energy and utilities, manufacturing and automotive and industrial growth. By  2022 it may reach $ 48.6 Billion.  The most popular computer vision companies include TRACTABLE, VERKADA, HAWK-EYE among others.

## Digital Twin
It is a virtual representation of physical objects that are designed to be exactly reflected. The object and investigation include a variety of sensors. These sensors collect data on the energy production, temperature, weather condition and other objects' characteristics of the physical performance. This information is subsequently sent to a processing machine where itâ€™s applied to a digital copy. This technology is used for building, manufacturing plants, cars or any complex objects to monitor. This will assist in the transformation of numerous processes as well as detection of potential future breakdowns, events and abnormalities in their functioning. Companies like Microsoft, siemens, oracle. IBM, CISCO among the other top tier company used the technology digital twin.

## Intelligence process Automation (IPA)

Intelligence process Automation is the use of Artificial Intelligence and related emerging technologies to robotics processes such as computer vision, cognitive automation, and machine learning. According to McKinsey & company several industries that have experimented with Intelligence process automation have achieved impressive results with the automation of about 50 to 70% of tasks, 25 to 30% annual cost reduction and ROI in triple-digit %. It's safe to say the benefits of Intelligence process Automation are a significant implication of the returns amplification of the returns RPA offers companies like CAPGEMINI, IBM, Deloitte, SAP etc are reading deploying Intelligence process Automation their organization.
