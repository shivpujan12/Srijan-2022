What if we just not wear jewellery to adorn ourselves but also it serves a meaningful purpose to our daily problems. Why not have a fashion wave embedded with the technology?

Digital jewellery serves as a solution to the above-stated problem.

It is fashion embedded with intelligence in the form of accessories worn by people. It not only enhances an individual’s personality but also act as a replacement for credit cards, loose cash, different components of mobile phones like speakers, microphone, touchpad, display, circuit board, antenna and battery etc.It is a wireless wearable computer providing an individual with personalized and customized information.

IBM has worked upon a miniature cell phone that consists of different pieces of digital jewellery that work together wirelessly due to the Bluetooth Wireless technology. Various components of it are as follows:Stylish earrings are being embedded with speakers that act as Bluetooth device providing user with the functionality of a phone receiver.Necklaces and pendants are being embedded with a microphone that consists of sensors which help users to talk.Rings equipped with LEDs that flash to indicate an incoming call or could indicate that an email is piling up in the user’s inbox. It may flash in different colours to indicate the importance of the incoming call like red for spam calls etc.Bracelets are equipped with graphic display screens which flash to indicate the name and phone number of the caller and even can act as a dial pad or keypad for sending a message or dialling a phone number.

All these components serve all the salient features of the mobile phone from making a call via a bracelet to flashing of call visible to us via rings and then receiving and hearing it via earrings and talking through necklaces making our life seamlessly easy.

One of the examples of digital jewellery includes the Xiaomi mi smartwatch which includes almost all the features of a smartphone.it includes fitness and health-tracking features, built-in GPS for accurately tracking outdoor activities, as well as an optical heart rate sensor for all-day heart rate data. Not only this it acts as a prototype of the cellular device as it includes a microphone and speaker that allows users to answer calls and also user gets a notification from applications like WhatsApp, Instagram and Messages on the smartwatch along with the icon of the application.

Applications of digital jewellery include Java Ring and IBM Ring.

Remembering passwords to log on to computers or taking care of your keys to unlock your doors is a tedious task. So as a solution Dallas semiconductor is developing a new Java-based computerised ring to unlock doors or log on to computers.It is a wearable component which is made of stainless steel and is 16 millimetres in diameter. It is highly durable and secure with a high memory capacity of 134 Kilobytes.

Another wonderful application includes the IBM magic decoder ring which is a mouse ring that uses Track Point Technology to wirelessly move the cursor on the computer’s display. We are already acquainted with the Track point as a little button embedded in the keyboard of some laptops. IBM researchers have put this tracking technology in a ring giving it a stylish touch of black pearl. The upper portion of the ring includes a little black ball that users will roll to move the cursor, in the same manner as the track point button on the laptop is used to do.

Digital jewellery has several advantages which include portability that it can be easily worn upon rather than giving it an extra space in your bag. It does not require user interaction and the user could easily walk around or travel in a crowded vehicle.

Even after a plethora of its advantages, its disadvantages cannot be ignored. The health issues posed by these electronic devices cannot be optimised. It can range from an eye strain to headache. Also, the huge cost is making this jewellery unreachable to purchase.

The main aim behind digital jewellery is to have several electrical components integrated into different stylish accessories that are wireless and can easily be worn out without sitting in front of a desk and requires minimal user interaction. As the technology is expanding soon this jewellery will become part of people’s regular dressing and by the end of this decade, we all will be wearing our personal computers rather than sitting in front of them or carrying them in bags for work.
